# ST-lapboard
A project to provide my local clubs with cheap and tinkerfriendly lapboards to show the skaters their remaining laps. It allows for control via webpage/http requests and ESPNOW protocol from the remote controller.

The lapboard is made with ws2812b leds, arranged into segments.

Color is configurable per digit
